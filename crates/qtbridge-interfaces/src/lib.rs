//! # Qt Interfaces (Internal Documentation)
//!
//! This crate provides proxies for various Qt (C++) interfaces using Cxx.
//! Proxies serve as the bridge between Rust and C++ implementations of Qt
//! interfaces, allowing Rust types to implement behavior expected by C++
//! code and to access C++ functionality from Rust.
//!
//! ## The proxy
//!
//! Each Qt interface has a corresponding **proxy** in Rust. This proxy has
//! to implement the [`QRustProxy`] trait and interacts mostly with the [`QObjectHolder`]
//! trait, that is automatically implemented for all user types by qt_gen.
//!
//! The demands on proxies are baked into the [`QRustProxy`] trait. For example, there
//! is the demand to provide a Qt static meta object, usually from the "base" this proxy
//! is derived from. Further, the proxy has to provide a marker trait called `AdapterType`
//! that is at a minimum used to store a reference to the user object as
//! `Rc<RefCell<dyn AdapterType>>`. Otherwise the proxy is mostly free in its design.
//!
//! All proxies provided in this module follow a similar architecture. The proxy works
//! together with a set of traits. The QObject proxy is very different since it is the
//! proxy that is used if only QMetaObject functionality needs to be provided but no
//! interface implementation.
//!
//! ## Traits
//!
//! 1. **User-implemented functionality**: Rust implementations of Qt virtual functions.
//! 2. **Rust access to C++ functionality**: Rust wrappers around C++ methods of the interface.
//! 3. **Internal type erasure and proxy plumbing**: Allows dynamic behavior when types
//!    are not fully known at compile time.
//!
//! These proxies rely on the following Rust traits to define functionality and structure,
//! shown on the example of `QListModel`.
//!
//! ### 1. `QListModel`
//! * **Responsibility**: Must be implemented by the user.
//! * **Purpose**: Functions in this trait are called from C++ via the proxy, providing Rust
//!   implementations of Qt virtual functions. Some modifications can be done in the functions
//!   to shape the API and to erase Qt types (e.g. QVariant and QModelIndex).
//! * **Associated Types**: Defines types (e.g., `Item`) that are part of the interface contract.
//! * **Notes**: Users implement function as expected from the Qt API. Default implementation
//!   can exist for non-pure virtual functions.
//!
//! ### 2. `QListModelBase`
//! * **Responsibility**: Default / blank implementation for all `QListModel`.
//! * **Purpose**: Provides access to C++ functions from Rust and other convenience functions
//!   that should not be overridden. Serves as a bridge between user logic and C++ functionality.
//!   Functions that should not be overridden by the user are implemented here.
//! * **Notes**: This trait forms the core Rust interface to call C++ functions for types implementing
//!   `QListModel`.
//!
//! ### 3. `QListModelAdapter` (Internal Only)
//! * **Responsibility**: Default / blank implementation for all `QListModel`.
//! * **Purpose**: Provides a type-erased interface for internal machinery. Traits with associated
//!   types (like `QListModel::Item`) cannot be used as `dyn` traits in Rust. `QListModelAdapter`
//!   erases unknown types while exposing the necessary interface internally.
//! * **Notes**: Never meant for user implementation or usage. Facilitates dynamic behavior and
//!   internal bridging without exposing associated types to user code.
