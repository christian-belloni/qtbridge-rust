# Contributing

First of all, thank you for considering contributing!

This project is in **early and active development**, and we are actively
looking for contributors. Even if you're just getting started with QML,
Qt Quick, or Rust, you're very welcome to contribute — small contributions
are just as valuable!

If you're a student or new to open source, this is a great place to start.

⚠️ **Important:** The repository on GitHub is a read-only mirror. We do not
accept GitHub Pull Requests. Instead, we use **Gerrit** for code review.

## Qt Account

Before contributing, you need to create a [Qt account](https://login.qt.io/register).
This account is used to authenticate you across Bug tracker, Gerrit and Wiki.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways you can help:

- Fix issues
- Report bugs
- Suggest new features
- Improve documentation

## Getting the Source Code

Clone the repository from the official source with git hooks:

```shell
git clone "https://codereview.qt-project.org/qt/qtbridge-rust" && (cd "qtbridge-rust" && mkdir -p `git rev-parse \
 --git-dir`/hooks/ && curl -Lo `git rev-parse \
 --git-dir`/hooks/commit-msg https://codereview.qt-project.org/tools/hooks/commit-msg && chmod +x \
 `git rev-parse --git-dir`/hooks/commit-msg)

cd qtbridge-<lang>
git checkout dev
```

## Configure Gerrit

Log into [Gerrit](https://codereview.qt-project.org/) and add necessary
information to your account. Remember to accept
[Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.qt.io/community/legal-contribution-agreement-qt).

Configure Gerrit by following **How to get started - Gerrit registration**,
**Local Setup** and **Configuring Git** sections from the
[Setting up Gerrit](https://wiki.qt.io/Setting_up_Gerrit) wiki page.

After correct configuration you should see the following message
when trying `ssh codereview.qt-project.org` command:

```shell
  ****    Welcome to Gerrit Code Review    ****

  Hi <name>, you have successfully connected over SSH.

  Unfortunately, interactive shells are disabled.
  To clone a hosted Git repository, use:

  git clone ssh://<username>@codereview.qt-project.org:29418/qt/qtbridge-<lang>.git

Connection to codereview.qt-project.org closed.
```

## Development setup

For a development setup you will need the same prerequisites as for using
QtBridge. This is described in README.md.

When the prerequisites are installed, the code is checked out from source,
and Gerrit is configured, you are also ready for developing QtBridge.

The top-level repository folder is a Rust workspace. By default, only the
core crates and tests are built:

```shell
cargo build
cargo test
```

To build the full workspace including example apps:

```shell
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

CI runs the full workspace build, so you should run `cargo test --workspace`
before submitting a change to Gerrit.

## Find something to work on

### Fix something you have discovered

If you've found a bug or have an idea for an improvement, feel free to
work on it directly. For larger changes, it's a good idea to open an issue
first to discuss it. See [Reporting Bugs](https://wiki.qt.io/Reporting_Bugs)
for more details.

### Picking an existing issue

If you're not working on something specific, check our
[Bug Report system](https://qt-project.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20%22QTBRIDGES%22%20AND%20component%20%3D%20%22Rust%22)
for open issues.

If you're unsure what to pick, feel free to ask on our
[Qt Bridges forum](https://forum.qt.io/category/78/qt-bridges) or join
[Qt Bridges Discord](https://discord.com/invite/WNdGHnHagP) - we're happy
to help you get started!

## Making changes

1. Create a new branch:

`git checkout -b feature-name`

2. Make your changes
3. Keep changes focused and minimal

## Commit and Push

Once you have your local patch ready to submit, check the
[Commit Policy](https://wiki.qt.io/Commit_Policy) and remember to add a
**Task-number:** or **Fixes:** entry to the commit footer.

Commit your changes:

```shell
git add <the files you modified>
git commit # this will open an editor, for you to write a commit message
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/dev
```

Your change will now appear in [Gerrit](https://codereview.qt-project.org/)
for review, where you will be able to modify the commit message, add reviewers
and view your change in detail.

## Reporting Bugs and Suggestions

If you're not contributing code, you can still help by reporting bugs or
suggesting features in our
[Bug Report system](https://qt-project.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/QTBRIDGES/components).
When reporting an issue, please see
[Reporting Bugs](https://wiki.qt.io/Reporting_Bugs) first.
